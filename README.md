# AVR MultiTasking OS 
#### *This is a Simple Multi-tasking OS that runs on AVR 8-bit microcontrollers. This repo also contains an example that uses 10 Threads and 4 software Timers and one mutex to contol the access to an LCD* <br>
 ## - this OS has many features :<br>
 #### *1 - allows you to create as many as threads you want unless the memory size allows .* <br>
 #### *2- allows you to set priority to each task (lowest value is Higher priority).* <br>
 #### *3 - Task Suspend.* <br>
 #### *4 - Timer Support Techniques , such as :* <br>
    i)Task Delay .
    ii)Software Timers (Two modes , ONE_SHOT or CIRCULAR ) .
